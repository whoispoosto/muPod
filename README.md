TODO: im not writing "drivers" -- they are simply interfaces that follow the POSIX standard! only use the interface as a guideline... create the simplest interface possible. don't feel forced to use the driver interface simply because it's an embedded project. STM has written most of the drivers I'll need

TODO: error handling macro that maybe takes advantage of errno if needed? If not, research errno vs returning error which is better
